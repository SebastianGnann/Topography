Workflow to extract landform classes using QGIS

Open DBF file with excel and save a copy
Then manually edit the file to get relevant columns, e.g. Value and World_Lan1, and add = between them
1 = 4
2 = 4
...

Save this as a txt file, edit the text tile and replace the tabs with spaces

Then this can be used with r.reclass() in QGIS to reclassify the raster
