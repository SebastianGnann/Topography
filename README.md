# The influence of topography on the global terrestrial water cycle

Note: the paper has not yet been reviewed.

Repository for review paper that contains the code used to make most of the plots. Other plots were made using QGIS or re-used from existing papers.

plot_climatic_water_balance_elevation_profiles: plots P and PET against elevation for different rectangular swaths in different mountain ranges (Figure 2a)

plot_swath_precipitation: plots P transect along swath (Figure 2b)

plot_precipitation_uncertainty: plots P and PET transects for different forcing products in different regions (Figure 9 and Figure S2)

analyse_Caravan: plots BFI and other baseflow signatures from Caravan against topographic slope (Figure 6a and Figure S6) and calculates fraction of observations per landform

analyse_Fan: plots WTD against topographic slope (Figure S7) and calculates fraction of observations per landform

analyse_Moeck: plots recharge against topographic slope and calculates fraction of observations per landform

plot_DataBias: plots fration of landforms globally and fraction of observations per landform for Caravan, Fan, and Moeck data

calculate_averages_per_landform: calculates average P and PE per landform.

analyse_global_distributions: calculates global distributions of landforms and their slopes.

resample_rasters: resamples and aligns different rasters
